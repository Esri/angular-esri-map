angular-esri-map
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/angular-esri-map.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/angular-esri-map)

A collection of directives to help you use Esri maps and services in your AngularJS v1.x applications.

These directives can be used as-is if your mapping needs are simple, or as reference examples of the patterns that you can use to write your own directives that use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. [Read more...](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/#/about)

## Getting Started

Here are [examples and guides](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/) showing how you can use this module to bring Esri maps into your own AngularJS v1.x applications.

### Quick Start

To use these directives in your own AngularJS v1.x application, first install the module as a dependency using any of the following methods.

```html
<!-- load angular-esri-map from CDN -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/angular-esri-map@2"></script>
```

```bash
# OR install via bower
bower install angular-esri-map

# OR install via npm
npm install angular-esri-map
```

Alternatively, you can clone or [download](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map/releases) this repo and copy the desired module file (`angular-esri-map.js` or `angular-esri-map.min.js`) into your application.

Once you've added the module to your application, you can refer the sample code below to use the `<esri-scene-view>` directive. If you have downloaded or installed locally, point to the location of the module file in your environment (instead of CDN) and load the page in a browser.

        <script>
            angular.module('esri-map-example', ['esri.map'])
                .controller('MapController', function(esriLoader) {
                    var self = this;
                    esriLoader.require(['esri/Map'], function(Map) {
                        self.map = new Map({
                            basemap: 'streets'
                        });
                    });
                });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

See the documentation for [examples and guides](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map) of how to use the other directives and services.

### Lazy Loading of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

If your application only shows a map under certain conditions you may want to lazy load the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. You can do this by calling the `esriLoader.bootstrap()` method. See the [Lazy Load Patterns page](http://esri.github.io/angular-esri-map/#/patterns/lazy-load) for an example of how to do this.

## Dependencies

At version 1.x, these directives and services require, at a minimum, AngularJS v1.3.0 and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript v3.12 (though most will work and are tested on v3.11).

For version 2.x, the ArcGIS API for JavaScript v4.0 is required.

See the compatibility table below for details.

angular-esri-map | AngularJS | ArcGIS API for JavaScript | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
v1.0.0 | v1.3 - v1.5 | [v3.12+](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/) | Test coverage included for AngularJS v1.3.
v1.1.0 | v1.3 - v1.5 | [v3.15+](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/) |
v1.1.8 | v1.3+ | [v3.15+](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/) | Due to a breaking change in controllers at AngularJS v1.6, e2e test coverage has been performed with v1.3, but will only continue with v1.6. See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map/blob/v1.x/CHANGELOG.md#v118).
v2.0.0 | v1.3 - v1.5 | [v4.0+](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) | Test coverage included for AngularJS v1.3.
v2.0.2 | v1.3+ | [v4.0+](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) | Due to a breaking change in controllers at AngularJS v1.6, e2e test coverage has been performed with v1.3, but will only continue with v1.6. See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Esri/angular-esri-map/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v202).

## What about Angular 2?

While **angular-esri-map** focuses on providing well tested directives and patterns to help you use Esri maps with AngularJS v1.x, the ArcGIS API for JavaScript can also be used with [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). In addition to the [Angular 2 specific information](http://jwasilgeo.github.io/esri-jsapi-and-angular-whats-next-dev-summit-2016/#/34) discussed in the [2016 "What's New, What's Next" presentation](http://jwasilgeo.github.io/esri-jsapi-and-angular-whats-next-dev-summit-2016) provided above, there are several resources available to inspire you to try out Esri+Angular 2.

* [jwasilgeo/angular2-esri-playground](https://github.com/jwasilgeo/angular2-esri-playground): Example app using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript v4 with Angular 2 loaded via esri-system-js

## What about Ionic?

Ionic is a mobile-ready implementation of Angular that is built on top of Cordova/PhoneGap. The coding patterns shown above can also be used with Ionic.

* [andygup/ionic2-esri-map](https://github.com/andygup/ionic2-esri-map): Example using ArcGIS API for JavaScript with Ionic2 using the angular2-esri-loader pattern with webpack.

2. `cd` into the `angular-esri-map` folder
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. run `gulp` from the command line. This will run the linting and build commands and then start a local web server hosting the application under the `docs` folder
